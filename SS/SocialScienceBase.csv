"1","acepack","Two nonparametric methods for multiple regression transform selection are provided. The first, Alternative Conditional Expectations (ACE), is an algorithm to find the fixed point of maximal correlation, i.e. it finds a set of transformed response variables that maximizes R^2 using smoothing functions [see Breiman, L., and J.H. Friedman. 1985. ""Estimating Optimal Transformations for Multiple Regression and Correlation"". Journal of the American Statistical Association. 80:580-598. <doi:10.1080/01621459.1985.10478157>]. Also included is the Additivity Variance Stabilization (AVAS) method which works better than ACE when correlation is low [see Tibshirani, R.. 1986. ""Estimating Transformations for Regression via Additivity and Variance Stabilization"". Journal of the American Statistical Association. 83:394-405. <doi:10.1080/01621459.1988.10478610>]. A good introduction to these two methods is in chapter 16 of Frank Harrel's ""Regression Modeling Strategies"" in the Springer Series in Statistics.","Phil Spector, Jerome Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, Thomas Lumley, Shawn Garbett, Jonathan Baron","acepack results","SocialSciences","MIT + file LICENSE","Shawn Garbett  <shawn.garbett at vanderbilt.edu>","NEWS","yes","2016-10-29","testthat","1.4.1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"nlts","Hmisc",NA,NA,NA
"2","Amelia","A tool that ""multiply imputes"" missing data in a single cross-section (such as a survey), from a time series (like variables collected for each year in a country), or from a time-series-cross-sectional data set (such as collected by years for each of several countries). Amelia II implements our bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches, is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can handle many more variables. Unlike Amelia I and other statistically rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please let us know if you find to the contrary!). The program also generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values of missing cells in their data. Amelia II also includes useful diagnostics of the fit of multiple imputation models. The program works from the R command line or via a graphical user interface that does not require users to know R.","James Honaker,

The multinomial probit model is often used to analyze the discrete choices made by individuals recorded in survey data.

The MNP package can also fit the model with different choice sets for each individual, and complete or partial individual choice orderings of the available alternatives from the choice set. The estimation is based on the efficient marginal data augmentation algorithm that is developed by Imai and van Dyk (2005). “A Bayesian Analysis of the Multinomial Probit Model Using the Data Augmentation,” Journal of Econometrics, Vol. 124, No. 2 (February), pp. 311-334. <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2004.02.002> Detailed examples are given in Imai and van Dyk (2005). “MNP: R Package for Fitting the Multinomial Probit Model.” Journal of Statistical Software, Vol. 14, No. 3 (May), pp. 1-32. <doi:10.18637/jss.v014.i03>.","Kosuke Imai [aut, cre],

In addition, the quality of imputation can be visually explored using various univariate, bivariate, multiple and multivariate plot methods. A graphical user interface available in the separate package VIMGUI allows an easy handling of the implemented plot methods.","Matthias Templ, Andreas Alfons, Alexander Kowarik, Bernd Prantner","VIM results","Multivariate, OfficialStatistics, SocialSciences","GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (≥ 2)]","Matthias Templ  <matthias.templ at gmail.com>","README NEWS","yes","2017-04-11","dplyr","4.7.0","VIM citation info","R (≥ 3.1.0), colorspace, grid, data.table (≥ 1.9.4)","car, grDevices, robustbase, stats, sp, vcd, MASS, nnet, e1071, methods, Rcpp, utils, graphics, laeken","Rcpp","https://github.com/statistikat/VIM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"VIMGUI","robCompositions, sdcMicro, simPop, smartdata","micemd, simputation",NA,NA

"60","Zelig","A framework that brings together an abundance of common statistical models found across packages into a unified interface, and provides a common architecture for estimation and interpretation, as well as bridging functions to absorb increasingly more models into the package. Zelig allows each individual package, for each statistical model, to be accessed by a common uniformly structured call and set of arguments. Moreover, Zelig automates all the surrounding building blocks of a statistical work-flow–procedures and algorithms that may be essential to one user's application but which the original package developer did not use in their own research and might not themselves support. These include bootstrapping, jackknifing, and re-weighting of data. In particular, Zelig automatically generates predicted and simulated quantities of interest (such as relative risk ratios, average treatment effects, first differences and predicted and expected values) to interpret and visualize complex models.","Christine Choirat [aut],
