"2","abn","Bayesian network analysis is a form of probabilistic graphical models which derives from empirical data a directed acyclic graph, DAG, describing the dependency structure between random variables. An additive Bayesian network model consists of a form of a DAG where each node comprises a generalized linear model, GLM. Additive Bayesian network models are equivalent to Bayesian multivariate regression using graphical modelling, they generalises the usual multivariable regression, GLM, to multiple dependent variables. 'abn' provides routines to help determine optimal Bayesian network models for a given data set, where these models are used to identify statistical dependencies in messy, complex data. The additive formulation of these models is equivalent to multivariate generalised linear modelling (including mixed models with iid random effects). The usual term to describe this model selection process is structure discovery. The core functionality is concerned with model selection - determining the most robust empirical model of data from interdependent variables. Laplace approximations are used to estimate goodness of fit metrics and model parameters, and wrappers are also included to the INLA package which can be obtained from <http://www.r-inla.org>. A comprehensive set of documented case studies, numerical accuracy/quality assurance exercises, and additional documentation are available from the 'abn' website.","Gilles Kratzer  [aut, cre],

The first variant is a variable-by-variable imputation combining sequential regression and Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) that has been extended for unordered categorical data. The Bayesian Bootstrap allows for generating approximately proper multiple imputations. The second variant is also based on PMM, but the focus is on imputing several variables at the same time. The suggestion is to use this variant, if the missing-data pattern resembles a data fusion situation, or any other missing-by-design pattern, where several variables have identical missing-data patterns. Both variants can be run as 'single imputation' versions, in case the analysis objective is of a purely descriptive nature.","Florian Meinfelder [aut, cre],

A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, meta-analytic standard errors, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. Model fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks and leave-one-out cross-validation. References: BÃ¼rkner (2017) <doi:10.18637/jss.v080.i01>; Carpenter et al.

Typically, volumes are collected as slices of 64 x 64 voxels. Analysis of fMRI data often relies on fitting linear regression models at each voxel of the brain. The volume of the data to be processed, and the type of statistical analysis to perform in fMRI analysis, call for high-performance computing strategies. In this package, the CUDA programming model uses a separate thread for fitting a linear regression model at each voxel in parallel. The global statistical model implements a Gibbs Sampler for hierarchical linear models with a normal prior. This model has been proposed by Rossi, Allenby and McCulloch in ‘Bayesian Statistics and Marketing’, Chapter 3, and is referred to as ‘rhierLinearModel’ in the R-package bayesm. A notebook equipped with a NVIDIA ‘GeForce 8400M GS’ card having Compute Capability 1.1 has been used in the tests.

The mixing parameter can be estimated by a marginal maximum likelihood approach. This leads to an adaptive thresholding approach on the original data.

It also allows for fixed effects in the response model, where a spatial CAR (conditional autoregressive) term can be also included.

Several samplers and label switching moves are implemented along with diagnostic tools to assess convergence. A number of R functions for post-processing of the output are also provided.

The Stan project develops a probabilistic programming language that implements full Bayesian statistical inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo, rough Bayesian inference via 'variational' approximation, and (optionally penalized) maximum likelihood estimation via optimization. In all three cases, automatic differentiation is used to quickly and accurately evaluate gradients without burdening the user with the need to derive the partial derivatives.","Jiqiang Guo [aut],
